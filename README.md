-Debate Social Network-

In early development phase...

This project concerns a focused kind of social network, where the members register
for a debate or discussion. On personal social networks we can see this kind of usage
growing as the world sees polemic and controversial events happen.

The Debate Social Network facilitates and make it public those debates and discussions,
where the author of a debate makes a appealing overview of the discussion with a strong main
picture that represents that subject. The main page shows the most discussed debates, the most upvoted
comments and more.

What we have for now:

-Users can create an account to use the social network;<br />
-Users can create a new debate with the status open or closed;<br />
-Users can post their opinions on debates;<br />
-3 main debates appear on the main page as featured;<br />

To do:

-Users can upvote a opinion (and that will be used as criteria for the top 3 debates
featured on the main page);<br />
-Categories for debates;<br />
-Search for debates;<br />
-Personal page for the user, where he/she can see his debates and opinions;<br />
-Articles (Articles will be different from debates, it show immediately a opinion from the author
on the main text, allowing comments instead of opinions);<br />
-Share with Facebook and Twitter functionalities;<br />
-...<br />
